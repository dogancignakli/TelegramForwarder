The Simple Read-Forward Bot for Telegram.
This bot has written via Python3. I used telethon libraries to implement it.

This bots purpose is, read  messages from a chat( you can select), and forward theese to another chat(you can select this too)
You need to go to https://my.telegram.org and take your api_hash and api_id (If you cant: https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id)
After you login your account succesfully, you must select a chat get this chats id to read data. (To get chat id: https://www.alphr.com/find-chat-id-telegram/)
After you get this datas, change this  datas and comments on the code.

If you cant use the bot. Feel free to ask.
